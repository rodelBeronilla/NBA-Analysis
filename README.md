*NBA Team Performance Analysis
This project aims to analyze NBA team performance using data obtained from the NBA API. The analysis includes various aspects such as schedule data, team records, offensive and defensive ratings, player statistics, game data, advanced metrics, and contextual factors. By leveraging this data, teams, analysts, and enthusiasts can gain insights into team performance, make informed decisions, and assess various factors affecting gameplay.

**Schedule Data - Get Teams Playing
The project retrieves schedule data from the NBA API to identify teams playing on specific dates. It utilizes the games endpoint to fetch game information for a given date. The retrieved data includes details such as team IDs, game outcomes, scores, and venues.

**Team Records
The project calculates home and away records for each team based on the schedule data obtained. It identifies home and away games by comparing the arena city with the team city. The records include the number of wins and losses for both home and away games.

**Offensive and Defensive Ratings
Using the game data, the project calculates offensive and defensive ratings for each team. Offensive rating (ORtg) represents the points scored per possession, while defensive rating (DRtg) represents the points allowed per possession. These ratings provide insights into team efficiency on offense and defense.

**Player Data
The project analyzes player statistics, including player efficiency rating (PER), win shares, plus/minus statistics, and minutes played. It also tracks injury status and history to monitor player availability. Player performance metrics are updated after each game to reflect the latest data.

**Game Data
Game data such as game ID, date, time, venue, referee assignments, team matchups, and historical outcomes are collected and analyzed. Additionally, Vegas odds, player matchups, and other contextual factors are considered to assess game dynamics.

**Advanced Metrics and Analytics
Various advanced metrics and analytics are computed based on player and team performances. These metrics are recalculated after each game to provide up-to-date insights into team and player performance.

**External factors such as travel schedule, rest days, altitude of venue, player trades, and weather conditions are evaluated to understand their impact on team performance. Social media sentiment analysis is also performed to gauge public sentiment.

**Miscellaneous Data
Other miscellaneous data including coaching staff, playoff standings, team strategy, and in-season changes are considered in the analysis. Staying updated on news and team reports is crucial for making informed decisions.

**Overall, this project offers a comprehensive analysis of NBA team performance by leveraging data-driven insights and considering various contextual factors affecting gameplay. The analyses provided can aid teams, analysts, and enthusiasts in making informed decisions and understanding the intricacies of NBA games.
